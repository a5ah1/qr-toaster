# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-11

## Our Privacy Commitment

QR Toaster is built with privacy as the foundation. We believe your data is yours alone. This privacy policy explains how we handle (or rather, don't handle) your information.

## The Short Version

- **No servers involved** - All QR code generation happens entirely in your browser
- **No data collection** - We don't collect, store, or transmit your data anywhere
- **No tracking** - No analytics, no cookies, no fingerprinting
- **Open source** - All code is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/a5ah1/qr-toaster)

## Data Processing

### Client-Side Only

When you use QR Toaster to generate QR codes:

1. **All processing happens in your browser** - Your text, URLs, WiFi credentials, contact information, event details, and authentication codes are processed entirely on your device using JavaScript
2. **Nothing is sent to our servers** - We don't have servers that receive or process your QR code data
3. **No third-party services** - We don't use external APIs or services that could access your data

### Local Storage

To improve your experience, QR Toaster may store some data locally in your browser:

**What We Store:**
- **Non-sensitive form inputs** - For convenience, some generators may save your input (like event titles or contact names) in your browser's local storage so you don't have to re-enter them on your next visit
- **Appearance preferences** - Color choices, styling options, and other customization settings

**What We NEVER Store:**
- **WiFi passwords** - Never saved to local storage
- **OTP/2FA secret keys** - Never saved to local storage
- **Any data you mark as sensitive**

**You're in Control:**
- All locally stored data stays on your device
- You can clear this data anytime using your browser's settings
- Clearing your browser's local storage will remove all saved preferences

## Third-Party Code

QR Toaster uses the following open-source JavaScript libraries to generate QR codes:

- **qrcode-svg** - Lightweight SVG QR code generation ([License](https://github.com/papnkukn/qrcode-svg/blob/master/LICENSE))
- **qr-code-styling** - Advanced QR code styling with customization options ([License](https://github.com/kozakdenys/qr-code-styling/blob/master/LICENSE))

These libraries run entirely in your browser and do not communicate with external servers.

## Cookies and Tracking

- **No cookies** - QR Toaster does not use cookies
- **No analytics** - We don't track page views, clicks, or user behavior
- **No advertising trackers** - No third-party advertising or tracking scripts
- **No fingerprinting** - We don't attempt to identify or track individual users

## Hosted Version

The public version of QR Toaster is hosted on GitHub Pages:
- GitHub may collect standard server logs (IP addresses, access times) as part of their hosting infrastructure
- We do not have access to these logs
- See [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) for their practices

## Your Rights and Control

Since we don't collect or store your data:
- **No data to delete** - There's nothing for us to delete
- **No data to export** - All data stays on your device
- **No data to correct** - You control all data directly in your browser

To clear locally stored preferences:
- Use your browser's developer tools to clear local storage for this site

## Summary
